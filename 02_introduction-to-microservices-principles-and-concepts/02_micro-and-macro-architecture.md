# Introduction
- Microservices provide better decoupling;
- Architecture has to ensure that the services can work together;
- Micro architecture relates to decision made individually for each service;
- Macro architecture relates to decisions made at global level and that affect all services;

# DDD and Bounded Contexts
- DDD offers a collection of patterns for the domain model of a system;
- Simplest design consists of multiple specialized domain models tha are valid only in a certain context;
- Communication between bounded contexts can be achieved through domain events;

# Strategic Design and Common Patterns
- Dividing a system into different bounded contexts is part of the strategic design;

# Architecture Decisions
