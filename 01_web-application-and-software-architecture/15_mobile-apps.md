# Types of Mobile Apps
- Native:
  - Specific for platform/OS;
  - Don't face any lag issues rendering UI animations;
  - UI is pretty responsive;
- Hybrid:
  - Primarily written in web-based technologies;
  - Run in a native container and communicate with the native OS via a wrapper or middle layer;
  - Because of the wrapper, they're a bit slower in terms of performance an rendering the UI;

# When to Pick Native
- When we have heavy graphic requirements and animations;
- When the app relies heavily on hardware accessm like camera, sensors, GPS etc;
- When the looks and feel should be identical to native OS;
- When competitors have native apps;
- When needs to support new mobile OS features as they're released;

# When to Pick Hybrid
- Simple requirements;
- Can't afford dedicated teams and codebases;
- MVP;
- Team not fluent in native technologies;

# PWAs
- Web apps with look and feel of native apps that can be installed from the browser;
- No native tech needed to be learned;
- Apps can work offline, have push notifications;

# Mobile Backend as a Service
- E.g: Firebase;
- Mobile apps are fat clients, all logic is in the app;
- Provides a bunch of features out of the box, like social authentication, push notifications, analytics etc;
